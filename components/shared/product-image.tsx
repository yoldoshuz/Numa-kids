/**
 * A packshot that survives its source going bad.
 *
 * Some catalogue records point at the original artwork rather than a web copy —
 * multi-megabyte PNGs of a single bottle — and the image optimizer abandons the
 * upstream fetch after seven seconds and answers 500. The card then rendered a
 * broken-image box.
 *
 * Nothing on this side can make that origin faster, so instead the failure is
 * caught: on error the image falls back to the bundled copy of the same
 * packshot, which is served off this deployment and cannot time out. Products
 * with no bundled copy keep the empty frame — there is no honest picture to
 * show for those.
 *
 * The real fix is upstream: re-upload those photos at web weight in the admin.
